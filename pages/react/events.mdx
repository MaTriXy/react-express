import nativeEvent from '../../examples/files/react/nativeEvent.js'
import customEvent from '../../examples/files/react/customEvent.js'

DOM nodes created with React, such as a button, fire the same DOM events they would in vanilla JavaScript.

To add an event handler, pass a function as a prop to a React element:

```js
<button
  onClick={e => {
    console.log(e)
  }}
/>
```

## Naming scheme

Event names are camel-cased, so we need to use `onClick` instead of the native equivalent, `onclick`. React normalizes these names across browsers, so we don't need to consider browser inconsistencies.

We can find the full list of events supported by React [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events).

## Event normalization

In addition to normalizing event names, React normalizes event objects created by the browser. React's events, also called **synthetic events**, have roughly the same interface as native events, so we can still call `e.stopPropagation()` or `e.preventDefault()`, and we can still access properties like `e.which()`. For more detail, check out the [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) page in the React docs.

## Example

Let's look at an example where we handle the `onClick` event of an element.

<Example code={nativeEvent} />

## Custom Components and Events

Let's say we want to make a custom `CounterButton` component with an `onClick` event. Creating a button with `<CounterButton onClick={() => ...} />` will tell React to instantiate our `CounterButton` class with the prop `onClick` set to a function. However, this alone won't make our `CounterButton` respond to clicks.

Only DOM components can handle DOM events like `onClick` - so our `CounterButton` must render a DOM component and pass the `onClick` prop into it. Our `CounterButton` is essentially a pass-through for the click event.

The name of the `onClick` prop passed to our `CounterButton` is arbitrary â€” we could name it anything we want, so long as somewhere within `CounterButton` we pass the prop into a DOM component's `onClick`. For example, we could decide to name the prop `onPress` and create our button `CounterButton` as `<CounterButton onPress={() => ...} />`. Within `CounterButton`, we would then want to render `<button onClick={props.onPress} />`.

<Example code={customEvent} />

Here we pass our `CounterButton` a prop `onPress`, which then gets passed into the `onClick` of a `button`.
