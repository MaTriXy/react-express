There are _many_ different ways to style React components. There isn't one "best" way to style components, and new style libraries are created frequently. The method you choose is often based on personal preference, since the features of each method are generally pretty similar.

We'll look at three broad approaches:

- Inline styles
- CSS and class names
- CSS-in-JS

When just getting started with React, I recommend choosing this way:

- If you don't know CSS already, use inline styles for simplicity, and choose something else when you have a better sense of your requirements (e.g. which browsers you'll want to support)
- If you have web development experience and know CSS already, use CSS and class names, so you're not learning 2 things at once
