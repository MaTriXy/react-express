## Creating a reusable button

One approach would be to pass a `title` string:

<Example code={buttonTitle} />

But this limits us to what we can pass.

## ReactNode

Using the type `ReactNode`, we can now pass arbitrary react elements.

<Example code={buttonTitleNode} />

## The `children` prop

Typically if the component has a "main" or "primary" content prop, we'll use the prop `children`. This lets us preserve the tree-like hierarchy of our JSX code. If a component has multiple props that can take arbitrary content, e.g. a `left` and `right`, then we probably wouldn't make either of these the `children`, since neither is more "main" or "primary" than the other.

<Example code={buttonChildren} />
