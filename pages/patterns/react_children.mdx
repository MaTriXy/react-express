import reactChildrenList from '../../examples/files/patterns/reactChildrenList.tsx'

We can use the `React.Children` APIs to modify elements created by React before they're rendered. For more info, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactchildren

For example, here we insert an `<hr />` element between any arbitrary children. Note that our `List` component accepts a `children` prop just like any other React component might, but then we transform the passed `children` before returning them from our `List`.

<Example code={reactChildrenList} />
